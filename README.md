# Incorrect Use of $inc Operator in MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in using the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.  The `$inc` operator is intended for updating documents, not for modifying the results of aggregation pipeline stages.  This example showcases the incorrect usage and the correct approach to achieve the desired outcome.

## Bug
The initial code attempts to increment the `count` field after the `$group` stage. This is syntactically valid, but it won't produce the expected outcome.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct way to increment the count either within the `$group` stage or using a separate update operation, depending on the desired outcome.
